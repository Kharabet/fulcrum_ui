            When using decentralized applications (dApps), it’s critical to remember that YOU are
            responsible for the security of your digital assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike mainstream financial services, our team can NOT help you recover your funds if
            you lose your private key.

            While bZx does maintain an insurance fund to protect against the improper liquidation of
            undercollateralized borrowers, we do NOT insure user funds in the event that the user
            loses access to - or control over - their private key.
          </p>
          <p>Here are our safety guidelines for using dApps:</p>
          <h3>Secure your digital assets carefully</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>ALWAYS use a trusted digital wallet provider</li>
            <li>NEVER share your private key and ALWAYS keep a backup</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Be wary of phishing attacks</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>ALWAYS make sure you have the correct URL</li>
            <li>Team members will NEVER message you first</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Do your own research</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              ALWAYS evaluate the smart contracts (Read our audits{' '}

            We have done our best to make this an effective resource for beginners wanting to learn
            how to secure their digital assets against the basic risks associated with dApps,
            however, it’s important to consider that using emerging technologies constitutes a risk
            unto itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Undiscovered vulnerabilities and the deployment of new dApps may cause unforeseen
            consequences. Users should always exercise caution when using emerging technologies.
