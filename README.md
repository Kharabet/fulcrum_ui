# User interfaces for fulcrum.trade, torque.loans, and some related packages

## Development

Check the `env.sample` files and create your own `.env`.  
Currently each app requires its own.

### Analyze bundle

Add `ANALYZE_BUNDLE=true` in your `.env` to enable [webpack analysis](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer).
